CS 430 Summer Project
========================

To Run
======
Run 'make' in the top level directory, Huffman_Encoding_Decoding

About
======
This program focuses on three areas:
1. Identifing the kth largest element in a list, using random selection and recursion
2. Sorting an unsorted list
3. Huffman encoding (incomplete)

This is a terminal program, where users will be prompted to make selections and enter values.  For ease, there is the option of randomly generating lists as needed and running the program in 'test mode'

At this time, 'test mode' only checks part 1&2, comparing the results against the built-in python functions for lists

Python
======
This was written in a virtual environment in python 3.5.2

The required packages are included in the requirements.txt and can be imported via:
	'pip install -r requirements.txt'
