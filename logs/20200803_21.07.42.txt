2020-08-03 21:07:42	Starting user prompts
	User chose to  pick a function
	User chose to randomly generate a list: [31, 40, 29, 42, 82, 61]
	#####


2020-08-03 21:07:54	Begin select function for randomized recusive finding of the 4th element of [31, 40, 29, 42, 82, 61]
	The randomly selected split element is: 31
	Elements smaller than the split: [29]
	Elements larger than the split: [40, 42, 82, 61]
	Elements equal to the split: [31]
	Look inside the larger elements
2020-08-03 21:07:54	Begin select function for randomized recusive finding of the 2th element of [40, 42, 82, 61]
	The randomly selected split element is: 40
	Elements smaller than the split: []
	Elements larger than the split: [42, 82, 61]
	Elements equal to the split: [40]
	Look inside the larger elements
2020-08-03 21:07:54	Begin select function for randomized recusive finding of the 1th element of [42, 82, 61]
	The randomly selected split element is: 82
	Elements smaller than the split: [42, 61]
	Elements larger than the split: []
	Elements equal to the split: [82]
	Look inside the smaller elements
2020-08-03 21:07:54	Begin select function for randomized recusive finding of the 1th element of [42, 61]
	The randomly selected split element is: 42
	Elements smaller than the split: []
	Elements larger than the split: [61]
	Elements equal to the split: [42]
2020-08-03 21:07:54	The 1th element is: 42
